Welcome to varietas.io. The project was originally started in 2018 as a result of the master thesis by Michael Rhöse. The topic of this thesis is:

**Conception and design of an adaptive, flexible, dynamically extensible and polyglot plugin framework based on an event-driven and non-blocking message bus.**

The abstract gives an short overview:

*Today, software development becomes a more and more complex process. The development of new software, features or patches in a short time period is required to increase user experience and business values. New technologies, methods and principles fit this need and make fast development of new software possible.*

*One of the most discussed topics are microservices. This highly modular concept of distributed systems supports independent publication and maintenance of individual parts. Additionally, microservices provide a better scalability at high utilization. Compared to monolithic applications the complexity and maintenance costs increased considerably due to the increasing size of a microservice system. In return, operation and management of monolithic software are more cost-effective, but scalability and maintenance are more expensive.*

*These points lead to the main question of this master thesis for the concept and design of a framework that combine the advantages of both system architectures. In addition, it should be possible to turn an application into a pure microservice system when necessary.*

*For this purpose, established frameworks are compared to show that existing implementation do not provide the necessary characteristics. Moreover, common properties are identified which are incorporated into the concept.*

*The architectural patterns implemented into a prototype – event-driven, microkernel and microservices architecture – as well as the inherited properties and mathematical concepts are defined and explained. Finally, details of the implementation are explained and the feasibility is checked with a simple test case by a dynamically extensible REST-API.*

*It becomes apparent that the realization of a dynamically extensible, flexible plugin framework is possible by the usage of established architectural concepts and additional libraries.*

The size and the potential of the resulting prototype leads Micha to publish the project and makes the framework available for contributers.

As a site-effect, the idea of a pure Open Source Community was born. This community aims to help beginners to start there own projects and helps them with basic engineering tools, tips and information.
